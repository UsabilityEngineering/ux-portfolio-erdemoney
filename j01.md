I recently got a new Logitech MX Master mouse for my computer and throught that would be a good topic for 
this journal entry. It has a few features that set it apart from other mice. For one it has a horizontal 
scroll wheel that you can use with your thumb. This makes scrolling around large webpages much
more intuitive in comparison to how you would have to do it otherwise. Also conveniently places right by
your thumb is the aptly named "gesture button." On macOS one of my largest qualms in that there are no 
obvious ways to use all of the convient trackpad gestures on a traditional mouse. The MX Master solves
this with the gesture button, when pressing the gesture button you can move the mouse in similar ways
to the trackpad gestures to trigger the same shortcuts. For example, I can press the gesture button
and slide my mouse left or right to change workspaces or up and down to trigger the app expose or 
launchpad. This makes navigating macOS much more consistent and learnable between different imput 
interfaces. Additionally the mouse has software that allows it to track seamlessly between two 
computers by just moving to the mouse to the edge of one screen and it will connect to the next computer.
It's clear that they put a lot of effort into making this as seamless and learnable as possible.
