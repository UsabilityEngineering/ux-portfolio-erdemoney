### Simplicity at the cost of usability

I'm the type of person that doesnt immediately buy into any shiny new piece of technology without taking into careful consideration if it will really improve my life. One thing that i havent been able to get behind is smart watches. Personally I find them to be redundant when you already have a smart phone and expensive. However I do find a regular watch to be a very necessary tool to have.<br><br>
I use a very simple Casio F-91W, watch that hasnt changed its design since the 90s and definitly looks like it. It's **effective** in doing what i need it to do, tell the time, with a large seven segment display. It even tells me the date too, all while being so light and small that I barely notice it. I never have to worry about charging it and if i lose it its only $5. However its far from perfect, it has only three buttons to interface with it. The one on the top-left operates the backlight to view the screen at night, the bottom left button changes the "mode", and the third buton on the bottom right is somewhat of a multifunction button. The watch has several features that are all operated by these three identical looking buttons. This makes using these functions not very **learnable**, or **memorable**. For example to use the alarm the user must press the "mode" button until they are in the alarm mode then the backlight button the enter the edit mode, then the time is set by pressing the multifunction button to set the hour and then the backlight button again to edit the minute. Then once the minutes is set press the backlight button once more to exit the edit mode. Now to activate the alarm the user has to press the multifunction button, and then the mode button to switch back to the clock screen. <br><br>
I just now after owning this watch for 3 years feel comfortable using all of the functions. The design choices that they made in making this watch to only have 3 buttons to perform all of the functions that it comes with make this watch have a very simple look at the cost of a steep learning curve.
